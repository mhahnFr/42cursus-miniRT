# Welcome to 42cursus-miniRT!
This repository contains a group project of the [42 school]. The task for the two students is to write a small raytracer
using the C programming language and the graphics library of the [42 school], the MiniLibX.  
This project has been done by **[kyomawolf]** and **[mhahnFr]**.

### Approach
At first, the command line arguments are parsed. After they set the rendering configuration as well as the scene file,
the scene is rendered as described below.

#### Rendering
In order to render a pixel, a ray is shot into the world. For every hit object, the distance between the camera and the
intersection point is calculated. The colour for the pixel is defined by this object. If that object is reflective, a
reflected ray is shot into the world, and the colour of the object is mixed with the colour of the reflected ray.  
If no object is hit by a ray, the ambient colour is used for further calculations.

The antialiasing is simply done by shooting multiple rays for each pixel into the world, all of them shifted a little.
All of them are then mixed together and define the colour of the pixel.

### Usage
In order to get started, clone and build the project:
- Clone: ``git clone https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/42cursus-miniRT``
- and build: ``cd 42cursus-miniRT && make``.

The application can either be started with only a file as parameter: ``./miniRT <file>``. The scene will be rendered
using the default settings. Using the following options, the settings can be adjusted:
- ``-h`` Prints the help screen. If launched without any parameters or the given parameter is not recognized, this
option is invoked.
- ``-v`` Displays the currently used rendering configuration.
- ``-m <bounces>`` Sets how often a ray that is rendered can bounce off surfaces.
- ``-a <factor>`` Sets the factor of antialiasing. Each pixel is rendered ``1 + factor`` times.
- ``-r <width> <height>`` Sets the resolution of the window.
- ``-f <file>`` Specifies the scene file to be rendered.

> _Please note:_ using the above described options requires the scene file to be specified using the ``-f`` option.

### Platforms
This project has been written for and was tested on _macOS 10.15.7_.

> As all other C projects at the [42 school], the code has to written in accordance
> with the [norm]:
> - Only 25 lines per function,
> - only 5 functions per file,
> - usage of only the allowed external functions.
